This tool encrypts according to a specific algorithm with key and word.Then save the encrypted cipher in "hashes.txt"

When you enter this program, first, the program check "hashes.txt" in same folder.The content of "hashes.txt" => $"platform name"$"hash"..

First platform name that important is su (Super User) password hash.Followings are other platforms.

If you want to enter the shell, must be login as Super User.

For access to all shell commands, must enter "help" in shell. It gives enough information.

For example "ExpectoTR" word and "2016" key values' output =>  4a6363B973F8BD6BB1
